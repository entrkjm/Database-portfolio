# Database Modeling
This document is to organize key concepts of database modeling 

# 1. Three key elements of data model
1. Data structure
2. Operations
3. Constraints

# 2. Process of database design
1. Specification and verification of requirements
2. Conceptual design
3. Logical design
4. Physical design
5. Implementation

## Conceptual design
Conceptual design aims at defining concepts of data for database. This stage includes transaction modeling.
ER model is one of the output from this stage.

## Logical design
This stage is to design transaction interfaces and evaluate data models(e.g ER model).
Normalization is performed in this stage.

## Physical design
Physical design stage considers how data is stored in a physical storage.
It also includes handling frequently requested data and distribution of it to implement stable database.
