# 1. What is Relational Database?
A relational database (RDB) is a way of **structuring information in tables, rows, and columns**.
An RDB has the ability to establish links—or relationships–between information by joining tables, 
which makes it easy to understand and gain insights about the relationship between various data points. 

**Formal term**

* Table = Relation
* Attribute = Column
* Row = Tuple
